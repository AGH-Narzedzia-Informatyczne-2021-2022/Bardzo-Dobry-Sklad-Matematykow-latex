\subsection{Text}
Anakin grew up as a slave, a slave, on a miserable planet that is made up of sand in its entirety. I'd wager he has a lot of experience on why sand sucks ass. Anakin also built electronics as a kid and it's completely understandable that it'd be super annoying to clean sand out of sensitive equipment. \par
It's also important to look at Padme's dialogue as well. Can you remember what she says before Anakin mentions his hate for sand? Probably not. Here it is. \par
\textbf{Padme:} "We used to come here for school retreat. We would swim to that island every day. I love the water. We used to lie out on the sand and let the sun dry us and try to guess the names of the birds singing." \par
\textbf{Anakin:} \underline{"I don't like sand.} It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere." \par
Padme is reminiscing about the good ol' days. Anakin, being madly in love, is trying to have a conversation; trying to relate. \par
But it's bad writing you say. Well, no, I don't think so. Remember that Anakin is 19 years old. Most 19 year old guys don't know how to talk to girls at this age. It's not really fair for anyone to expect Anakin to be a smooth talker like Han Solo under the circumstances. His age isn't even his biggest crux though. Again, Anakin was a slave as a child then joined an Order that had a strict code that forbade romantic relationships. Anakin literally has zero experience with girls. Most normal guys at 19 can at least say they've been exposed to girls in a more "romantic" way since middle school but Anakin is completely deprived of these experiences. Because of all this, I think the way he talks to Padme is actually good writing. It makes complete sense that he's awkward and sometimes creepy, and don't think for a second that this wasn't intended. \par
So there. Would you say was unfair with my assessment? I'm not trying to say this scene is a \emph{masterpiece.} I'm not trying to say it's a bad scene with some redeeming qualities. \textit{I'm saying that it's just a normal scene that people focus on too much.} \par

Here is a random formula that probably means nothing:
