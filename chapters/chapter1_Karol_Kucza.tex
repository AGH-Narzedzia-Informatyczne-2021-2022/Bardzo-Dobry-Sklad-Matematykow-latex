\subsection{Text}
To be fair, you have to have a \underline{very high IQ} to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation – his personal philosophy draws heavily from \textbf{Narodnaya Volya} literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny – they say something deep about \emph{LIFE}. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly \emph{ARE} idiots – of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase  \textit{``Wubba Lubba Dub Dub``}, which itself is a cryptic reference to \textbf{Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons} I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. \par
And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the \underline{ladies' eyes only} – and even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

Table~\ref{tab:multiplication_table} is a multiplication table.



This equation is called Euler's identity: \[e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0\]

And here is the Pythagorean identity:
$ \sin^2\alpha + \cos^2\alpha = 1 $
